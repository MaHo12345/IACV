    "    days = age * 365\n",

    "The function will return the variable written next to the ```return``` word and will stop execution after. To add a comment to your code (that will not be executed and is just needed to make the code better readable, use hash (```#```).\n",
    "To call a function after its definition, just type its name and pass its arguments in the brackets, as in the example below.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "days = compute_number_of_days(22)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "    print('Hello ' + name + '! You have already lived on this planet for ' + str(days) + ' days!')\n",

    "```\n",
    "Hello Nikolay! You have already lived on this planet for 8030 days!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Another important concept of Python is lists. Lists are similar to arrays in other languages, and are used to aggregate multiple (dis)similar objects in a sequence. It is very easy to define them as in the following example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "ages_parents = [51, 52]\n",
    "ages_children = [2, 4, 10]\n",
    "```\n",
    "This code creates 2 lists. The first list stores ages of parents, and the second stores ages of their kids. You can easily concatenate arrays with the plus sign:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "ages_family = ages_parents + ages_children\n",
    "print(ages_family)\n",
    "```\n",
    "This code will print\n",
    "```\n",
    "[51, 52, 2, 4, 10]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Another important structure in Python is the ```for``` loop, which is used to repeatedly perform the same operation. You can call a ```for``` loop for each element of a list in the way shown below:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "total_age = 0\n",
    "for age in ages_family:\n",
    "    total_age = total_age + age\n",
    "print(total_age)\n",
    "```\n",
    "This code will print 119, which is the total age of the people in the family. Note that you must *indent* the commands inside the ```for``` loop. The end of these commands is implicitly defined by switching to the previous indentation level. This is also the case for other Python structures, such as function definitions, ```while``` loops etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, you can also iterate with an index and not array elements. This is useful in many cases, for example, when you have a second array that corresponds to the first one. Consider the following example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "ages_family = [51, 52, 2, 4, 10]\n",
    "names = ['Patrick', 'Maria', 'Emma', 'Jordi', 'Vasiliy']\n",
    "```\n",
    "We have two lists, the first containing the ages of family members and the second containing their names. To find out the length of an array, you can use ```len()``` command. For example,\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(len(names))\n",
    "```\n",
    "will print 5. Knowing the length of the list, you can iterate over it by using indexing. Consider the following example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for i in range(0, len(names)):\n",
    "    current_name = names[i]\n",
    "    current_age = ages_family[i]\n",
    "    print_congratulations(current_age, current_name)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Here, we use ```[i]``` to access the i-th element of the list. The above code will print the following:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Hello Patrick! You have already lived on this planet for 18615 days!\n",
    "Hello Maria! You have already lived on this planet for 18980 days!\n",
    "Hello Emma! You have already lived on this planet for 730 days!\n",
    "Hello Jordi! You have already lived on this planet for 1460 days!\n",
    "Hello Vasiliy! You have already lived on this planet for 3650 days!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also nest the loops inside each other – but be sure you don't forget to use proper indentation and a different index variable for each loop. Have a look at the next example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for i in range(3, 7):\n",
    "    for j in range (100, 103):\n",
    "        mul = i * j\n",
    "        print('If you multiply ' + str(i) + ' by ' + str(j) + ', you get ' + str(mul))\n",
    "```\n",
    "It will print\n",
    "```\n",
    "If you multiply 3 by 100, you get 300\n",
    "If you multiply 3 by 101, you get 303\n",
    "If you multiply 3 by 102, you get 306\n",

You need to define a function to compute an area of one triangle, and then use a for loop to compute the total sum. A hint: when defining the function for area calculation, divide not by 2 but by 2.0. This will trigger *type coercion* so that a floating-point division is performed instead of an integer division. E.g. 5 / 2 = 2, but 5 / 2.0 = 2.5."

    "## Part 2. Working with matrices\n",
    "The real power of Python is revealed when it comes to packages. Packages can be thought of as libraries and provide code and functions for specific applications. One of the most important and popular packages in Python is **numpy**. It is designed for scientific computing and has excellent support for matrix operations that are essential in Computer Vision. It is also well-documented online (e.g. https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.13.0/reference/), with detailed explanations of functions, arguments, concepts etc.\n",

    "This calls ```rand()``` function from the ```random``` subpackage.\n",

    "```python\n",
    "A = np.matrix([[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]])\n",

    "This will create the following matrix:\n",
    "$A = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 \\\\ 3 & 4 \\\\ 5 & 6 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n",
